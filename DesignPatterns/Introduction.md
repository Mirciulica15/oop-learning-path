# Design Patterns Introduction

## What are Design Patterns?

- They will **not generate** ready code for you
- Instead, they provide a **template** to follow; a series of **formalized best practices** tested and verified by developers before you

Design Patterns became famous after the release of the "GoF (Gang of Four) Book", Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, published in the mid 90s

## Groups of Patterns

- _Creational:_ they deal with the **creation** of objects

- _Structural:_ they deal with how classes are actually designed; (e.g., how **inheritance, composition and aggregation** can be used to provide **extra functionality**
